The introduction of social media has been a disaster for the human race.  Since its introduction, we are significally less happy. People -- especially young people -- are more depressed the more time they spend looking down at their phones. In the short decade since the rise of Facebook, Twitter, and the iPhone, our society has become intensely polarized along political, social, and gender lines. We are more lonely, get married less, have less children, make less money, are less productive, and even live shorter lives.

# What is Social Media?

We live our lives as best we can, while in the background our world is slowly being replaced with an electronic fantasy. Your world is what you look at every day. Do you spend your day looking at the beautiful ones, pretending to be happier than they really are? Do you spend your day listening to hostile, alienated political activists who want to make their problems your problems? Do you spend your day pulling that list down to refresh, hoping for something new, or a notification, a little bit of attention?

From pixel art and futurism themes to talent stack and choice of profession, my aesthetic is unambiguous. I have always loved machines. I grew up with Kurzweilian fantasies about our luxurious space-faring future. Every technology has its dark side, of course, and I always strove to balance my techno-optimism with honesty about the dangers. I've been in meetings where higher-ups pushed us to trap our loyal customers in our product for longer. Its hard for me to look at the cyberpunk dystopia of the last decade and not say, "My God, what have we done?"

# Has Technology Gotten Worse?

The first electronic social network in mass use was the telephone. A land-line telephone connects one household to another. If you called someone you met in school, you might have to talk to his or her mother or father first, or even a neighbor. But it was worth it. Once the conversation got started, the reciever was already warmed up to your face, the soft plastic cradling your ear as that friend on the other end whispered about their minor troubles of the day.

You couldn't watch TV or listen to music while on the phone. You could do a minor task with your hands, if the cord was long enough. Usually you only talked to one person at a time, but the conversation could go on for hours -- at least until someone else had to make a call.

Originally, you got a direct analog circuit connecting you directly to them. But one day technologists realized they could increase the number of calls per wire by digitizing the sound of the call. In the process, they clipped the upper and lower frequencies, frequencies which we supposedly cannot hear, frequencies which may contain subtle emotional information. And so telephone was replaced with an electronic fantasy version.

Today, people -- especially young people -- rarely talk on the telephone. A smartphone just isn't comfortable to hold while talking. The sound quality is abjectly terrible -- gone are the warm tones and rock-solid reliability of yesteryear. Nowadays, it's considered downright rude to make a phone call, to the person you are calling and to anyone around you. Phone calls are for prospective employers, bill collectors, and your parents. In ten years, the phone system will be completely dead.
